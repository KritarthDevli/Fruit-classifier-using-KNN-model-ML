## 📘 About the Project

This beginner-friendly project demonstrates:
- Supervised machine learning classification
- Using KNN for prediction
- Taking user input for real-time predictions
- Basic Python programming and `scikit-learn` usage

The model is trained on a small dataset of fruits with their weight (grams) and size (cm).
